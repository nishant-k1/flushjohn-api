- Manual joins required

### After Migration

- ✅ ObjectId references populated where possible
- ✅ Sales orders linked to leads and customers
- ✅ Job orders linked to sales orders
- ⚠️ 1 quote has data format issue (can be fixed manually)

---

## What's Now Available

### You Can Now Use:

```javascript
// Fetch sales order with related data
const salesOrder = await SalesOrder.findById(orderId)
  .populate("lead")
  .populate("customer")
  .populate("quote");

console.log(salesOrder.lead.email); // Access lead directly
console.log(salesOrder.customer.phone); // Access customer directly
```

```javascript
// Fetch job order with related data
const jobOrder = await JobOrder.findById(jobOrderId)
  .populate("salesOrder")
  .populate("lead")
  .populate("customer");

console.log(jobOrder.salesOrder.salesOrderNo);
console.log(jobOrder.lead.email);
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Application ✅

- ✅ Verify existing functionality works
- ✅ Check new reference fields
- ✅ Test creating new records

### 2. Start Using New References

**Example: Create Quote with Reference**

```javascript
export const createQuote = async (quoteData) => {
  const quote = await Quote.create({
    lead: quoteData.leadId, // ✅ Use ObjectId reference
    quoteNo: await generateQuoteNumber(),
    products: quoteData.products,
  });

  // Update lead's quotes array
  await Lead.findByIdAndUpdate(quoteData.leadId, {
    $push: { quotes: quote._id },
  });

  return quote;
};
```

**Example: Fetch with Populate**

```javascript
export const getQuoteById = async (id) => {
  return await Quote.findById(id)
    .populate("lead") // ✅ Auto-fetch lead
    .populate("customer"); // ✅ Auto-fetch customer
};
```

### 3. Fix Data Issue (Optional)

If you want to fix the quote with incompatible leadNo:

```javascript
// Find the quote
const quote = await Quote.findOne({ quoteNo: "L883064" });

// Fix manually if needed
// Or update Lead model to accept string leadNo temporarily
```
