For a construction site with 20 or fewer workers, at least one portable toilet must be provided. For every additional 20 workers, another unit is necessary.</li>\n    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Portable toilets must be placed within a reasonable distance from the work area, typically no more than 10 minutes walking distance.</li>\n    <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Regular servicing and maintenance of the units are essential to meet sanitation standards and keep the facilities in good working order.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Understanding these requirements will help you avoid fines and ensure a smooth operation on your site.
